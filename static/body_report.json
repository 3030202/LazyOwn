At LazyOwn RedTeam Security Labs we specialize in manual assessments that go beyond basic automated tests to \r\n identify real attack vectors that can be used against your application. \r\n With decades of combined experience, LazyOwn RedTeam Security Labs is at the forefront of application security and \r\n penetration testing. With a veteran team of subject matter experts, you can be sure every resource is an authority in \r\n their field.", "service_description": "Penetration Testing is the process of simulating real-world attacks by using the same techniques as malicious \r\n hackers. For a security assessment that goes beyond a simple vulnerability scanner, you need experts in the industry. \r\n Extensive Application Assessment \r\n With their growing complexity and demand, web applications have become the target of choice for hackers. LazyOwn RedTeam \r\n Security Labs\u2019 Application Service offerings help protect your enterprise applications' web services from a range of \r\n security threats. \r\n Application security issues are not only the most common type of vulnerability, they\u2019re also growing in complexity. \r\n While the OWASP Top 10 is used as the standard for identifying application security flaws, that\u2019s just a start - many \r\n advanced vulnerabilities are not included in that list. Automated vulnerability scanners and penetration testers \r\n focused on OWASP will fall behind new threats, leaving the application exposed to unknown risks. \r\n At LazyOwn RedTeam Security Labs, we go far beyond the OWASP Top 10, continually pushing the boundaries of application \r\n security and detailing the way unique architectures can be abused - and how to fix them. \r\n Manage Application Security Risk \r\n Webservers are no longer just for marketing. Often the interface to an entire suite of technologies, web \r\n applications can tie into critical databases, vulnerable libraries, and plugins, XML and LDAP capabilities, underlying \r\n operating systems and client web browsers. It\u2019s never \u201cjust a website\u201d anymore, making them even more difficult \r\n to protect.", "campaign_objectives": "Vulnerability Identification \r\n LazyOwn RedTeam Security Labs\u2019 consultants use the results of the automated scan, paired with their expert knowledge and \r\n experience, to finally conduct a manual security analysis of the client\u2019s applications. Our assessors attempt to exploit \r\n and gain remote unauthorized access to data and systems. The detailed results of both the vulnerability scan and \r\n the manual testing are shown in this report.", "process_and_methodology": "LazyOwn RedTeam Security Labs used a comprehensive methodology to provide a security review of Contoso\u2019s web application(s). \r\n This process begins with detailed scanning and research into the architecture and environment, with the performance \r\n of automated testing for known vulnerabilities. Manual exploitation of vulnerabilities follows, for the purpose of \r\n detecting security weaknesses in the application. \r\n  \r\n Reconnaissance \r\n The primary goal in this process is to discover crucial data about Contoso\u2019s applications, providing \r\n the foundation for a tailored penetration test. Reconnaissance is carried out via automated \r\n scanners (such as nmap), as well as application fingerprinting and discovery. \r\n Automated Testing \r\n LazyOwn Security Labs used a vulnerability scanner to provide a foundation for the full manual \r\n assessment, and each finding is manually verified to ensure accuracy and remove false positives. \r\n Exploration and Verification \r\n LazyOwn RedTeam Security Labs\u2019 consultants use the results of the automated scan, paired with their expert \r\n knowledge and experience, to finally conduct a manual security analysis of the client\u2019s applications. \r\n The detailed results of both the vulnerability scan and the manual testing are shown in the tables \r\n below. \r\n Assessment Reporting \r\n Once the engagement is complete, LazyOwn RedTeam Security Labs delivers a detailed analysis and threat \r\n report, including remediation steps. Our consultants set an industry standard for clear and concise \r\n reports, prioritizing the highest risk vulnerabilities first. The assessment includes the following: \r\n \u2022 Executive Summary \r\n \u2022 Strategic Strengths and Weaknesses \r\n \u2022 Identified Vulnerabilities and Risk Ratings \r\n \u2022 Detailed Risk Remediation Steps \r\n \u2022 Assets and Data Compromised During Assessment \r\n Optional Remediation \r\n As an optional addition to the standard assessment, LazyOwn RedTeam Security Labs provides remediation \r\n retesting for all vulnerabilities listed in the report. At the conclusion of the remediation testing and \r\n request of the client, LazyOwn RedTeam Security Labs will update the report with a new risk level determination \r\n and mark which vulnerabilities in the report were in fact remediated to warrant a new risk level.", "scoping_and_rules": "While real attackers have no limits on Web Application Penetration, we do not engage in penetration testing activities \r\n that threaten our ethics and personal privacy. \r\n Constraints \r\n No additional limitations were placed upon this engagement, as agreed upon with Contoso. \r\n Assessment Scope \r\n LazyOwn RedTeam Security Labs compiled the following notes during the reconnaissance portion of the Web Application \r\n Penetration Test. These notes provide the information needed to accurately assess the application and test for \r\n vulnerabilities.", "executive_summary_findings": "LazyOwn RedTeam  Security Labs conducted a Web Application Penetration Test for Contoso. This test was performed to assess \r\n Contoso\u2019s defensive posture and provide security assistance through proactively identifying vulnerabilities, validating \r\n their severity, and providing remediation steps. \r\n LazyOwn RedTeam Security Labs reviewed the security of Contoso\u2019s infrastructure and has determined a Critical risk of compromise \r\n from external attackers, as shown by the presence of the vulnerabilities detailed in this report. \r\n The detailed findings and remediation recommendations for these assessments may be found later in the report. \r\n Web Application Risk Rating \r\n LazyOwn RedTeam Security Labs calculates web application risk based on Exploitation Likelihood (ease of exploitation) and Potential \r\n Impact (potential business Impact to the environment).", "executive_summary_narrative": "Part of our methodology involves looking through error messages to obtain more information about the environment \r\n we're operating within. From these error messages we were able to identify multiple critical vulnerabilities over the \r\n course of this engagement.", "summary_vulnerability_overview": "<b>LazyOwn RedTeam Security Labs:</b>\r\n<p> \r\n Performed a Web Application Penetration Test for Contoso on 07/02/2025 - 07/02/2025. This \r\n assessment utilized both commercial and proprietary tools for the initial mapping and reconnaissance of the site(s), as \r\n well as custom tools and scripts for unique vulnerabilities. During the manual analysis, assessors attempted to leverage \r\n discovered vulnerabilities and test for key security flaws, including those listed in the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities list. \r\n The following vulnerabilities were determined to be of highest risk, based on several factors including asset criticality, \r\n threat likelihood, and vulnerability severity. \r\n Vulnerability Risk Definition and Criteria \r\n The risk ratings assigned to each vulnerability are determined by averaging several aspects of the exploit and the \r\n environment, including reputation, difficulty, and criticality. \r\n</p>\r\n<span class=\"badge badge-dark\">CRITICAL</span><p>Critical vulnerabilities pose a serious threat to an organization's security, and should be \r\n        fixed immediately. They may provide a total compromise of the target environment, or \r\n        similar critical impacts. </p>\r\n<span class=\"badge badge-danger\">HIGH</span><p> High risk vulnerabilities provide a serious risk to the company environment and should \r\n        be corrected promptly. These issues can significantly affect the organization's security \r\n        posture. </p>\r\n<span class=\"badge badge-warning\">MEDIUM</span><p> Medium severity vulnerabilities represent a moderate risk to the environment. They may \r\n        require additional context before remediation but should be remediated after critical \r\n        and high risks. </p>\r\n<span class=\"badge badge-info\">LOW</span><p> Low severity vulnerabilities provide minimal risk to the target environment, and often \r\n        theoretical in nature. Remediation of low risks is often a lower priority than other \r\n        security hardening techniques. </p>\r\n<span class=\"badge badge-primary\">INFORMATIONAL</span> <p>Informational vulnerabilities have little-or-no impact to the target scope by themselves. \r\n    They are included however, as they may be a risk when combined with other \r\n    circumstances or technologies not currently in place. Remediation of informational items \r\n    is not necessary.</p>", "security_labs_toolkit": "The software and tools used for security analysis are constantly evolving and changing.
