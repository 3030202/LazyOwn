description: >
 CVE-2025-24071: NTLM Hash Leak via RAR/ZIP Extraction and .library-ms File. Windows Explorer automatically initiates an SMB authentication request when a .library-ms file is extracted from a .rar archive, leading to NTLM hash disclosure. The user does not need to open or execute the fileâ€”simply extracting it is enough to trigger the leak. https://cti.monster/blog/2025/03/18/CVE-2025-24071.html
